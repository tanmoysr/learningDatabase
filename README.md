## Components:
The following picture and the block of lines are directly quoted from [ByteByteGoHq Repository](https://github.com/ByteByteGoHq/system-design-101)

There are 5 components of the SQL language:
1. DDL: data definition language, such as CREATE, ALTER, DROP
2. DQL: data query language, such as SELECT
3. DML: data manipulation language, such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
4. DCL: data control language, such as GRANT, REVOKE
5. TCL: transaction control language, such as COMMIT, ROLLBACK
For a backend engineer, you may need to know most of it. As a data analyst, you may need to have a good understanding of DQL. Select the topics that are most relevant to you.
